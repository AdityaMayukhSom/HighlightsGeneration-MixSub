                    Fuzzy based self organizing aggregation method was suggested in the present study for swarm robots . In the suggested method Swarm robots evaluate their limited sensor input via rules of fuzzy logic and display aggregation behavior with the suggested aggregation method . In the meantime swarm robots also have the ability to escape the obstacles in a bounded arena with this method . Swarm robots perceive the neighboring robots with this method make individual decisions and display aggregation behaviors . Different from the traditional self organizing aggregation methods the suggested approach utilizes fuzzy logic controllers to evaluate limited sensor data . Systematic experiments were applied on different number of swarm robots with different detection areas in arenas of different sizes . Moreover noise was applied on the sensor inputs for examining the performance of the fuzzy logic based self organizing aggregation method . The scalability and flexibility of the self organizing aggregation behaviors of swarm robots were evaluated by way of systematic experiments . The swarm robots displayed aggregation behavior during the systematic experiments applied despite the changes in the number of robots and detection distances .
